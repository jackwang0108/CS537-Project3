<h1>Project 3a: Parallel Sort</h1> 
</font> 
</center> 

<h2>Important Dates and Other Stuff</h2> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday, 11/07 by midnight.</p> 

<p><b>This project is to be done in a group of size one or two.</b> </p> 

<p><b>Tests:</b> Tests will be made available shortly.</p> 

<h2>Questions?</h2> 

<p>Send questions using piazza or use office hours. If the question is about
your code, copy all of of your code into your handin directory (details below)
and include your login in your email (you are free to modify the contents of
your handin directory prior to the due date). Do <b>not</b> put code snippets
into piazza (unless they are very short). Also include all other relevant
information, such as cutting and pasting what you typed and the results from
the screen. In general, the more information you give, the more we can help.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>The basic project description is found
<a href=https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/concurrency-sort>here.</a> 
Please read this carefully in order to understand exactly what to do.</p> 

<p>This project is to be done on the lab machines (listed
<a href=https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-instructional-facilities/>
here</a> ), so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based
platform (Linux).</p> 

<h2>Differences</h2> 

<p>There are no differences from the github specified project.</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>Before beginning:</b> If you don't remember much about the Unix/C
environment, read
<a href=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf>this tutorial.</a> 
It has some useful tips for programming.</p> 

<p><b>This project should be done in groups of one or two.</b> Copying code
(from other groups) is considered cheating. Read <a href=../dontcheat.html>this</a> 
for more info on what is OK and what is not. Please help us all have a
good semester by not doing this.</p> 

<h2>Contest</h2> 

<p>There will be a contest for the <b>fastest</b> sort. More details coming
soon. Winner gets a choice of OSTEP merchandise!</p> 

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>You should turn in two files, <code>psort.c</code> and <code>Makefile</code> . The
makefile should build the <code>psort</code> executable.</p> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-1/handin/login/p3a</code> where <code>login</code> is
your login. For example, Remzi's login is <code>remzi</code> , and thus he would copy
his beautiful code into <code>~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a</code> . Copying of
these files is accomplished with the <code>cp</code> program, as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
prompt> cp psort.c Makefile ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a/
</pre> </blockquote> </p> 

<p>When done, type <code>ls ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a</code> to see that all the
files are in place correctly.</p> 

<p>Finally, in your p3a directory, please include a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit. There is no particular requirement for the
length of the README; just get in the habit of writing a little bit about what
you did, so that another human could understand it.</p> 

<p>We will add directions for how to handin something when you have a group of
two shortly.</p>
