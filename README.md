## Project Instuctions

### Important Dates and Other Stuff

**Due:** Monday, 11/07 by midnight

**This project is to be done in a group of size one or two.** 

**Tests**:Tests will be made available shortly.



### Questions?

Send questions using piazza or use office hours. If the question is about your code, copy all of of your code into your handin directory (details below) and include your login in your email (you are free to modify the contents of your handin directory prior to the due date). Do **not** put code snippets into piazza (unless they are very short). Also include all other relevant information, such as cutting and pasting what you typed and the results from the screen. In general, the more information you give, the more we can help.

### Overview 

The basic project description is found <a href=https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/concurrency-sort>here.</a>  Please read this carefully in order to understand exactly what to do.

This project is to be done on the lab machines (listed <a href=https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-instructional-facilities/>
here</a> ), so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform (Linux) 

### Differences 

There are no differences from the github specified project.

### Notes 

<b>Before beginning:</b> If you don't remember much about the Unix/C environment, read <a href=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf>this tutorial.</a>  It has some useful tips for programming.

<b>This project should be done in groups of one or two.</b> Copying code (from other groups) is considered cheating. Read <a href=../dontcheat.html>this</a>  for more info on what is OK and what is not. Please help us all have a good semester by not doing this.

### Contest 

There will be a contest for the **fastest** sort. More details coming soon. Winner gets a choice of OSTEP merchandise! 

### Handing It In 

You should turn in two files, <code>psort.c</code> and <code>Makefile</code> . The makefile should build the <code>psort</code> executable. 

The handin directory is <code>~cs537-1/handin/login/p3a</code> where <code>login</code> is your login. For example, Remzi's login is <code>remzi</code> , and thus he would copy his beautiful code into <code>~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a</code> . Copying of these files is accomplished with the <code>cp</code> program, as follows:

```shell
 cp psort.c Makefile ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a/
```

When done, type <code>ls ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a</code> to see that all the files are in place correctly.

```shell
ls ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p3a
```

Finally, in your p3a directory, please include a `README` file. In there, describe what you did a little bit. There is no particular requirement for the length of the `README`; just get in the habit of writing a little bit about what you did, so that another human could understand it.

We will add directions for how to handin something when you have a group of two shortly.
